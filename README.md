# Machine Learning with Python Certification Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning with Python Certification Projects repository. Here, you will find the solutions for the certification projects included in the Machine Learning with Python course offered by freeCodeCamp.

## Course Overview
Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job. In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

### Courses Included:
1. **TensorFlow:** Created by Tim Ruscica, this course explains TensorFlow's capabilities and how to build neural networks.
2. **How Neural Networks Work:** By Brandon Rohrer, this course demystifies neural networks and their mathematical foundations.

## Projects
Demonstrate your solid foundational knowledge of machine learning by completing the following projects:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors Game**
2. **Cat and Dog Image Classifier**
3. **Book Recommendation Engine using KNN**
4. **Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator**
5. **Neural Network SMS Text Classifier**

Finish all the projects to claim your Machine Learning with Python Certification.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into folders for each project. Each folder contains the code and any necessary data for the project.
